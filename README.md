## Data/Operation Abstraction Design: 
This data is gathered by aggregating FIFA Rankings data of the 32 teams as well as their scores from their individual matches. The dataset was filtered to only include data from the year 2018 and after. This is because the teams should be analyzed from their matches following the last World Cup. 

  **Rankings:**
  In order to visualize the data, a line graph was created, but the y-axis (FIFA Rankings) was inverted. The graph was inverted to show that a teamâ€™s      improvement in rank was parrallel with the direction of the graph. 

  **Scores:**
  The mean scores were aggregated from each of the 32 teams and their respective scores were averaged from the past 4 years.



## Future Work:
- Add a live dashboard that could scrub the match data live
- Add scores from each of the games which will allow for further analysis of the entire tournament
